Pagination:
  ☐ All
  ☐ Analysis Requirements(Statement, Goal ...)
    split a lot of data into small pieces 
    - split data
    - navigation control
    - constant size
    - staying status
    - optimise performance

    Page Based Pagination:
      page number
    - problem
      - data insert -> if new data is inserted between skip data, then new data cannot be shown, and last loaded data is duplicated.
      - data delete -> if data is deleted between skip data, then first data of next page is skipped.

    Cursor Based Pagination:
      last loaded item id
    - advantage
      - data insert -> if new data is inserted between skip data, then last loaded data is not duplicated.
      - data delete -> if data is deleted between skip data, then first data of next page is not skipped.
    - problem
      - implementation is complex than page based pagination
